# AMK-110HS-CAMERA-FIRMWARE
I managed to clone the firmware of a the AMK-110HS Camera which I had with me for years and it was just sitting in my draw and it had no purpose to me as the battery had degraded and the image and video quality of the camera was not that great. So I decided to tear it down and when I did so ,I noticed that the PCB had a Winbond spi flash chip and a NovaTek chip. I tried searching for the datasheet for the NovaTek chip all over the internet but unfortunetly I did not manage to find it but I did find out that Novatek makes image and video processing chips. Also I noticed that this particular NovaTek chip model can also drive a TFT LCD. So I desoldered the Windbond chip from the PCB and soldered it to a SOP8 to DIP8 PCB adapter and hooked it up to my CH341 board and cloned the firmware from it.
